Examples of Lifecycle Configuration
 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-configuration-examples.html#lifecycle-config-conceptual-ex7


* Triggers for replication are:

  - Uploading objects to the source bucket.
  - DELETE of objects in the source bucket.
  - Changes to the object, its metadata, or ACL.

* What is replicated:

  - New objects created after enabling replication.
  - Changes to objects.
  - Objects created using SSE-S3 using the AWS managed key.
  - Object ACL updates.

* What isnâ€™t replicated:

  - Objects that existed before enabling replication (can use the copy API).
  - Objects created with SSE-C and SSE-KMS.
  - Objects to which the bucket owner does not have permissions.
  - Updates to bucket-level subresources.
  - Actions from lifecycle rules are not replicated.
  - Objects in the source bucket that are replicated from another region are not replicated.

* Deletion behaviour:

  - If a DELETE request is made without specifying an object version ID a delete marker will be added and replicated.
  - If a DELETE request is made specifying an object version ID the object is deleted but the delete marker is not replicated.

* Charges:

  - Requests for upload.
  - Inter-region transfer.
  - S3 storage in both regions.
